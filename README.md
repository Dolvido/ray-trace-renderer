# Ray Tracing Renderer User Manual

## Introduction

The Ray Tracing Renderer is a software application that allows you to generate images using the ray tracing rendering technique. Ray tracing is a method for creating realistic images by simulating the path of light rays as they interact with objects in a scene. This technique can produce highly detailed and accurate images with realistic lighting and reflections.

## Main Functions

The Ray Tracing Renderer application provides the following main functions:

1. Scene Representation: You can create and define the objects in the scene, such as spheres, planes, and triangles. Each object can have its own material properties, including color, reflectivity, and transparency.

2. Ray Tracing Algorithm: The application generates rays originating from the camera and passing through each pixel of the image. It then determines where these rays intersect with the objects in the scene and computes the color of each pixel based on the light interactions at the intersection points.

3. Lighting Model: The application supports different types of lights, including point lights, directional lights, and area lights. It calculates shadows based on the visibility of points from the lights and implements reflection and refraction calculations for materials like mirrors and glass.

4. Camera System: You can define the viewpoint and field of view of the camera to view the scene from different angles. The camera can be moved within the scene to capture different perspectives.

5. Image Output: The application renders the scene to an image and saves it to a file, such as a PNG or BMP, without using external libraries. The rendered image can be viewed and shared with others.

## Installation

To install the Ray Tracing Renderer application, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Open a command prompt or terminal window.

3. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded or cloned the Ray Tracing Renderer application.

4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install the necessary dependencies, including NumPy.

## Getting Started

To start using the Ray Tracing Renderer application, follow these steps:

1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.

2. Navigate to the directory where you have downloaded or cloned the Ray Tracing Renderer application.

3. Run the following command to start the application:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

   This will launch the application's graphical user interface (GUI).

4. Use the GUI to interact with the application and create your scene. You can add objects, define their properties, set up lights, adjust the camera settings, and render the scene to an image.

5. Once you are satisfied with the scene and the image, you can save the rendered image to a file using the "File Output" feature.

## Usage

The Ray Tracing Renderer application provides a user-friendly interface for creating and rendering scenes. Here are some key features and tips for using the application:

- Scene Creation: Use the GUI to add objects to the scene, such as spheres, planes, and triangles. You can define their properties, including position, size, and material properties.

- Lighting Setup: Set up different types of lights in the scene, such as point lights, directional lights, and area lights. Adjust their positions, intensities, and other properties to achieve the desired lighting effects.

- Camera Control: Use the camera controls in the GUI to define the viewpoint and field of view. You can move the camera within the scene to capture different perspectives.

- Rendering: Click the "Render" button in the GUI to start the rendering process. The application will generate rays for each pixel of the image, determine the intersections with objects in the scene, and compute the color of each pixel based on the lighting model.

- File Output: After rendering the scene, you can save the rendered image to a file using the "File Output" feature. Choose a file format, such as PNG or BMP, and specify the file name and location.

- Optimization: If you encounter performance issues or long rendering times, you can optimize the application by implementing efficient algorithms and data structures. This can help improve the efficiency of the ray tracing process.

## Examples

Here are some examples of how you can use the Ray Tracing Renderer application:

1. Create a scene with a sphere and a plane. Set up a point light to illuminate the scene. Adjust the camera settings to capture the desired view. Render the scene and save the image to a file.

2. Experiment with different materials and their properties, such as reflectivity and transparency. Create objects with reflective surfaces, transparent materials, or a combination of both. Observe the effects of reflections and refractions in the rendered image.

3. Use multiple lights in the scene to create complex lighting setups. Combine different types of lights, adjust their positions and intensities, and observe the resulting lighting effects in the rendered image.

4. Create a scene with complex geometry, such as a mesh or a 3D model. Import the geometry into the application and define the material properties. Render the scene and save the image to a file.

## Conclusion

The Ray Tracing Renderer application provides a powerful tool for generating realistic images using the ray tracing rendering technique. With its intuitive interface and flexible features, you can create complex scenes, experiment with different materials and lighting setups, and produce high-quality rendered images. Start exploring the world of ray tracing and unleash your creativity with the Ray Tracing Renderer application.
